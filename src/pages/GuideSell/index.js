        <h2>How to add royalties?</h2>
        NFTs can be programmed so that each transaction includes royalties, allowing creators to be rewarded fairly for their work online. The fact that NFTs are created and stored on the blockchain, means they can be traded seamlessly from wallet to wallet, with royalties paid every time they move. On Martify, creators can set royalties up to 10%, and connect us via <a href="https://twitter.com/MartifyLabs">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/MartifyLabs">Discord</a>
